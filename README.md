This is the front-end dashboard for the [Groundskeeper Willie Security Auditor](https://github.com/devondev00-png/Groundskeeper-Willie).

It features:

* **Threat Radar**: Visualizes how much "Grease" is in your code.
* **Glassmorphism**: Because even brutal feedback should look pretty.
* **Ralph Trash Bin**: A dedicated area for failed AI assistants.

## 🚀 Deployment

Since this is a static site (HTML/CSS/JS), it can be deployed via GitHub Pages or Vercel immediately.
