### The Problem: We Are Drowning in "Polite" Garbage

We live in the age of AI coding assistants. They are polite. They are helpful. They are eager to please.

**And they write absolute garbage.**

I call it "**Ralph Wiggum Code**".
It looks like code. It runs like code. But deep down, it’s eating glue.

It catches errors with empty blocks.
It uses `eval()` because it's "easier".
It copies insecure patterns from 2014 StackOverflow threads because "it works".

And when you ask it to fix it? It apologizes.
*"I'm sorry, I seem to have made a mistake. Here is the same mistake again, but phrased differently."*

We don't need apologies. We need a **Groundskeeper**.

### Enter Willie ($WILLIE)

I built **Groundskeeper Willie** (`pip install groundskeeper-willie`) because I was tired of being nice to bad code.

Willie is a zero-tolerance, multi-language security auditor that hates your code almost as much as he hates Principal Skinner.

**What makes him different?**

#### 1. He Hunts "Ralph Wiggum" Patterns 🤡

Most scanners look for CVEs. Willie looks for stupidity.

- Empty `catch` blocks? **Flagged.**
- `console.log` in production? **Flagged.**
- Variables named `data` or `stuff`? **Flagged.**

#### 2. He Doesn't Suggest. He Fixes. 🛠️

Willie accepts `--auto-fix`.
He rips out the insecure patterns and replaces them with hardened, production-ready implementation.
*(Warning: He might insult you while doing it.)*

#### 3. He Speaks Over 15 Languages 🌍

Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Solidity...
If it can leak memory or funds, Willie can scan it.

### Why Open Source?

Security tools shouldn't be locked behind enterprise subscriptions.
The "Polite AI" problem affects everyone, from junior devs to senior engineers who are just too tired to double-check their Copilot output.

I made Willie **Open Source** because I want to raise the bar.
I want a world where "It Works on My Machine" is not a valid excuse.

### The Community: The Maintenance Crew 🧹

This isn't about trading. This isn't about "mooning".
This is about **Competence**.

If you are tired of debugging AI-generated spaghetti...
If you are tired of cleaning up other people's messes...
If you believe that if it's not Secure, it's CRAP...

**Join the Crew.**

1. **Star the Repo**: [GitHub Link]
2. **Install the Tool**: `pip install groundskeeper-willie`
3. **Post your worst findings**: Tag @WillieAuditor

Let's clean up this industry. One repo at a time.

**- HUX**
Maintainer, Groundskeeper Willie
